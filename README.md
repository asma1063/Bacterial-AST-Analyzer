# BioLab-Analyzer 🧫 

### **A Python-based utility for Automated Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST)**

This project bridges wet-lab diagnostics with computational logic. It automates the interpretation of bacterial inhibition zones using Python, targeting efficiency and accuracy in the clinical laboratory.

## 🌟 Project Overview & Scientific Context

- **Goal:** To interpret AST results based on **CLSI M100-Ed36 (2026)** standards (Susceptible, Intermediate, Resistant).
- **Application:** Clinical Microbiology & Bioinformatics.
- **Why it matters:** Automating this process reduces manual error and speeds up vital diagnostic reporting.

## 💻 Tech Stack & Skills Demonstrated

- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Concepts:** Nested Dictionaries, Data Formatting (`f-strings`), Algorithmic Logic.
- **Research Skills:** Application of international clinical standards (CLSI).

## 🚀 How to Run the Analyzer

1. Clone the repository: 
   ```bash
   git clone github.com[YOUR_USERNAME]/BioLab-Analyzer.git
